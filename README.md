j2l is a large-scale expansion project for jtool, an "I Wanna" fangame real-time map creation tool. This update is aimed at breathing new life into the tool as it hasn't been actively maintained in a long time, and its usage has been rapidly declining in the past couple years. "j2l" is basically jtool 2, with all the grace and freedom jtool originally had and more!
