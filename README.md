# j2l-expansion
j2l is a large-scale expansion project for jtool, an "I Wanna" fangame real-time map creation tool. This update is aimed at breathing new life into the tool as it hasn't been actively maintained in a long time, and its usage has been rapidly declining in the past couple years. "j2l" is basically jtool 2, with all the grace and freedom jtool originally had and more!

Current j2l plans:

[/] New save/load system
	
	[/] Backwards compatibility with Legacy jmaps
	[ ] Backwards compatibility with cmaps
	[ ] Backwards compatibility IWM maps
	[ ] Possible backwards compatibility with gmx room files
	[ ] Possible backwards compatibility with gm82 room files
  
[ ] All viable Crimson Needle 3 gimmicks / feature additions
  
[ ] All viable Morning Dew gimmicks / feature additions.

[/] Overhauled skinning system
